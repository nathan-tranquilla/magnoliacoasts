          I'm Stephanie, the owner and photographer of Magnolia Coasts
          Photography. I'm the woman behind the camera making magic happen by
          creating custom sets, wrapping and hushing babies to sleep and making
          children laugh.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a mama of two energetic kids who have are turned 12 and 10 and a
          fluffy white pup that just turned 4. They are everything to me and one
          the reasons I quit my day job and started photography!
        </p>
        <p>
          I used to be a teacher, but after a big push from my supportive
          husband and close friends, I launched a new career in something I was
          passionate about. I decided after my son was born that I wanted more
          flexibility, the ability to travel and less stress in my life. I fell
          in love with photography while traveling with my babies, documenting
          each milestone. Thus the obsessive hobby morphed into a bustling
          business and I haven’t looked back.
        </p>
        <p>
          In January 2015, I photographed my first baby. The baby boy had the
          same birthday as my daughter and the same name as my son. He fell
          asleep easily in my arms and it was "a sign" along with a few other
          series of events that would indicate this is what I was meant to do.
          It is still one of my most memorable shoots!
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then I have photographed over 1000 babies and still try to make
          every session unique and special for my clients. I love watching
          babies grow and be the “auntie” to so many as they hit one,
          two….five…. eight years old and have brothers or sisters or cousins.
        </p>

          Why Magnolia Coasts Photography? Well, that’s a story we’ll save for
          our chat when we meet up!

Her easy and friendly manner, professionalism and attention to detail made for a memorable and enjoyable experience. We absolutely love our family photos! Thank you, Stephanie, for capturing beautiful moments that will now become lasting memories."
let testimony2 = "Steph is Best baby photographer in town hands down... She was so accommodating and very gentle and thoughtful  handling my 10 days old baby. When we arrived at the studio she was waiting for us at the door and greeted us (very welcoming)...during the entire photoshoot she was patient and cool. Next day only we got our first 5 pictures so we could share it with our family...."

We have been going back to her for 5 years now and we have loved every single sessions and photos. Highly recommendedðŸ’•"

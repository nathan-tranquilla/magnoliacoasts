I'm Stephanie, the owner and photographer of Magnolia Coasts
Photography. I'm the woman behind the camera making magic happen by
creating custom sets, wrapping and hushing babies to sleep and making
children laugh with all those animal noises and silly antics. I have
10 years experience photographing children and families and cannot
wait to work with you!
